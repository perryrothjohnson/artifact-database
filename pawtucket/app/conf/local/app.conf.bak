### note: pawtucket doesn't override app/conf/app.conf
###       with this local file (app/conf/local/app.conf)
###       but instead overrides with the theme conf file
###       (themes/csc/conf/app.conf) ...so go edit that file instead!
###
### update: this may because this file had the wrong permissions
###         (group was 'perry' instead of 'www-data', so the server
###         didn't have access to this file)
### update2: apparently the theme's app.conf overrides the main app.conf
###          for pawtucket
